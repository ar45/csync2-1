csync2 (2.0+73d3293-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  csync2 changed the default database backend from SQLite2 to SQLite3. A new
  and empty SQLite3 db will be created in /var/lib/csync2 on the first run.
  The old SQLite2 database content is not automatically migrated.

  Nodes will automatically be added to the new database based on the preshared
  secret key configured, so no admin intervention is required to reconstruct
  the cluster.

  If the cluster is not fully synchronized before upgrading, synchronization
  conflicts might occur that require manual intervention. Use the "csync2 -x"
  and "csync2 -f /this/file/is/uptodate" commands to resolve these.
